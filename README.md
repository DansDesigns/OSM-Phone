**OSMâ€‘Phone**

The Last Phone Youâ€™ll Ever Need â€” Because You Actually Own It.

Forget planned obsolescence. Forget locked bootloaders. Forget asking permission to use your own hardware.

OSMâ€‘Phone is a modular, open-source smartphone platform built for makers, hackers, or anyone who wants to escape closed ecosystems and planned obsolescence.


Swap your compute module.
Boot the OS you want.
Repair, upgrade, or rebuild from scratch.
No subscriptions. No lock-in. No nonsense.


Whether you're running Android, Linux, building your own GUI or turning your device into a headless assistant, OSMâ€‘Phone gives you total control.
Itâ€™s a phone. A dev board. A daily driver. A modular toolkit. You decide.
