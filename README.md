**OSM‑Phone**

***The Last Phone You’ll Ever Need — Because You Actually Own It.***



Forget planned obsolescence. Forget locked bootloaders. Forget asking permission to use your own hardware.

OSM‑Phone is a modular, open-source smartphone platform built for makers, hackers, and anyone who wants to escape closed ecosystems.

Swap your compute module.
Boot the OS you want.
Repair, upgrade, or rebuild from scratch.
No subscriptions. No lock-in. No nonsense.

Whether you're running Android or Linux, Gaming or Working on-the-go, OSM‑Phone gives you total control.
It’s a phone. A dev board. A retro gaming console. A daily driver. You decide.

🛠️ Open. Modular. Evolving.
📡 M.2 radio module system.
🧠 Hack it. Flash it. Fork it.
This isn’t a product. It’s a platform.
